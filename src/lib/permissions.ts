/**
 * The permission catalogue: every area of the dashboard and REST API that an
 * administrator-only guard protects, and the actions on it. Each guarded call
 * site names exactly one permission (requirePermission in auth.ts,
 * requireApiPermission in api-auth.ts); ee/docs/custom-roles.md has the
 * call-site table and tests/unit/permission-call-sites.test.ts keeps the two
 * in step.
 *
 * Built-in roles: "admin" holds every permission; "user" and "viewer" hold
 * none of them, which is exactly what they could do before custom roles
 * existed (their profile, their API tokens and the overview page). Custom
 * roles (ee/custom-roles) hold a chosen subset, optionally limited to hosts
 * that carry one of the role's tags.
 *
 * Nothing here reads the database, so the client can import it
 * for the permission matrix and the navigation.
