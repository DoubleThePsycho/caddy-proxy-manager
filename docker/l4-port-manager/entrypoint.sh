# L4 Port Manager Sidecar
#
# On startup: makes sure the caddy container has the L4 ports bound (the main
# compose stack starts caddy without the L4 ports override file). Caddy is only
# recreated when it is not running with every port of the override, so a
# restart or an image update of this sidecar does not restart caddy as well.
#
# During runtime: watches the trigger file for changes and re-applies when
# the web app signals that port configuration has changed.
#
# Only ever recreates the caddy container — never touches any other service.
#
# Environment variables:
#   DATA_DIR              - Path to shared data volume (default: /data)
#   COMPOSE_DIR           - Path to compose files (default: /compose)
#   CADDY_CONTAINER_NAME  - Caddy container name (default: ingressi-caddy, then the "caddy" service of this
#                           sidecar's compose project, then the pre-rename caddy-proxy-manager-caddy)
#   COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME  - Override compose project name (auto-detected from caddy container labels if unset)
#   COMPOSE_HOST_DIR      - Only for non-standard bind-mount deployments: host
#                           path passed as --project-directory so relative
#                           bind-mount paths resolve on the host. The official
#                           named-volume setup must leave this unset.
#   POLL_INTERVAL         - Seconds between trigger file checks (default: 2)
#   COMPOSE_SKIP_OVERRIDE - If non-empty, skip docker-compose.override.yml (useful in test environments)
#   COMPOSE_EXTRA_FILE    - If set, include this additional compose file (e.g. a test-specific override)
#   APPLY_LOCK_MAX_AGE    - Seconds after which an apply lock is considered stale (default: 10)
#   CADDY_STARTUP_WAIT    - Seconds to wait at startup for a stopped caddy container to come back, e.g.
#                           while an image updater recreates it, before recreating it here (default: 60)
